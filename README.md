# face-detection-cropping

A GUI to automatically batch crop your portraits using face detection.

To use this GUI, you can either download the source code and generate the executable through the run.spec file using pysintaller
OR download the "dist" directory which contains the already packaged executable.

The opencv DNN algorithm is used to detect faces.
